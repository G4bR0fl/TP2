### Project 1:
In this project, we were assigned to divide a technological company into different sectors. Each sector has specific roles. And for each sector there's a director assigned to it. Each professional has a specific salary. The main focus of the project was to order the age of the employees, in crescent order.

**Note: The whole project must be object-oriented**
